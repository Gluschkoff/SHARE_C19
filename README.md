## R-script fot the preprint Big Five personality traits and COVID-19 precautionary behaviors among older adults in Europe, https://psyarxiv.com/rvbjf/

To account for the clustering of the respondents in countries, associations between personality and COVID-19 precautionary behaviors were examined with multilevel, randomintercept logistic regression models to avoid artificially low standard errors of estimates and
potentially inflated Type 1 error rate. The random intercept for country accounted for the potential non-independence of observations from the same country. The five personality traits
(extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, neuroticism, and openness) and the five
outcomes (wearing a mask, limiting social contacts, keeping distance, washing hands, and
using disinfectant) were analyzed in separate models (a total of 25 models).

We first examined the unconditional model without predictors to determine the
proportion of variance in the outcomes attributable to countries and individual-level factors. We then included the fixed effects of personality and covariates in the model. Personality
variables were standardized before the analysis. All analyses and data visualizations were
conducted in R Statistical Software (version 3.6.1; R Team, 2019) using the packages lme4
(Bates, MÃ¤chler, Bolker, & Walker, 2015) and ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016).

As a supplementary analysis, we examined the association between
personality and taking all three types of COVID-19 precautions (wearing a mask, limiting
social contacts, keeping distance, washing hands, and using disinfectant).
